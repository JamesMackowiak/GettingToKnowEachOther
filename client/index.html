<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is James Mackowiak, this is my 3rd year at Lewis University.<br>
    I am a Computer science major and I am thinking of concetrating in Video<br> Game Development
    I have 2 brothers and 1 sister which live with my Dad and I visit the, often.</p>
<br>
<h3>What I hope to learn from this course</h3>
<p>I am hoping to get to learn how to effectively work in a group on programming,<br>
    since none of my other classes had a focus on this style of programming.<br>
    I hope to be able to effectively learn how to use Cloud hosting and good habits<br>
    for software development. </p>
<br>
<h3>My favorite Hobby/Activity</h3>
<p>My favorite activity is playing video games or listening to music. I currently<br>
    play Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege or Destiny 2 right now. My favorite genre<br>
    of music is Country and my favorite song at the moment is 'Rich Men North of Richmond'<br>
    by Oliver Anthony</p>
<br>
<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I am in the Army Reserves and this will be my 5th year in<br>
    I have had lots of great memories and overall a great experience so far. I have also <br>
    done lots of cool things.</p>
